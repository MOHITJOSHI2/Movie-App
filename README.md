## Movie App
### This is a simple movie app that shows a list of movie which you can add to favourite and remove from favourite and aslo there is functionality for movie search. I am using "omdbapi" api to get the movie data so you will also need a omdb api key. You can get the key by simply signing at omdb website.

## Technologies used
* React + Vite

## Installation and Working
* First clone the repo into your directory
* After cloning the repo go into the directory by writing "cd Movie-App" in terminal
* Then in terminal write "npm i" to install necessary library
* Then in the src folder create a .env file and write your omdbapi key under a variable like "VITE_API_KEY=Your Key"
* then finally run "npm run dev" and a link will come go to the link and that's it
